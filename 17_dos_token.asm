; tokenizer
; in-place tokenize content of input line. Tokens are separated by space character.
; The tokenizer will not modify the input line but keep track of the current token
; in NEXT_TOKEN_PTR and NEXT_TOKEN_END:
;    NEXT_TOKEN_PTR: start of next token (relative to address of INPUT_LINE)
;    NEXT_TOKEN_END: end of next token (i.e. first char after token) this can either be a space or then end of input line
;
; normal usage:
; 1. call reset_tokenize to start tokenizer at start of input line
; 2. call read_token
;	if a token can be read NEXT_TOKEN_PTR and NEXT_TOKEN_END are set up and carry is set
;	otherwise carry is cleared (i.e. there are no more tokens) -> end loop
; 3. call retire token. This will advance NEXT_TOKEN_PTR to NEXT_TOKEN_END
; 	repeat at point (2) (i.e. the next read_token call)
